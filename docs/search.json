    "text": "1 Introduction\nStatistical computing is essential for scientific inquiry, discovery, and storytelling. As the availability of dataset and access to computing has significantly increased over the recent years, the scope of scientific inquiry is restricted, only, by the imagination of the inquirer.\n\n“Scientific inquiry starts with observation. The more one can see, the more one can investigate” — Martin Chalfie\n\nHowever, analysis of large-scale geospatial data (regional- to global scale at high spatial and temporal resolution) can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when working with multiple formats and sources of data. R- a higher-level programming language, provides a powerful computational alternative to popular Geographic Information System (GIS) software to organize, analyze and visualize geospatial datasets. R enjoys a vast collection of open-source libraries for GIS-type operations and proven statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities.\nIn this course, we equip ourselves with hands-on knowledge of accessing, analyzing, and visualizing open-source satellite remote-sensing and geospatial datasets for hydrological, agricultural, and climatological studies within the R environment. The objective of this course is to learn R for:\n\nAnalyzing geospatial datasets (raster and vector),\nPerforming statistical analysis for each feature/ layer, and,\nMapping and visualizing spatial datasets.\n\nThe course will include the latest R tools for working with global Earth-observation datasets, such as from NASA’s MODIS and SMAP satellites. Basic operations of geospatial analysis such as (re)projection, (re)sampling, summary statistics, merge/join, and (re)shape will be covered. The students will be introduced to structured/layered spatial datasets such as NetCDF and HDF formats used in climate modeling. Special emphasis will be placed on applying available out-of-the-box parallel computing techniques for geospatial analysis available in R.\nWe will first start with a refresher of basic R programming in Module 1. In Module 2 and 3, we will explore spatial data visualization, before we learn about large-scale application of parallel computing for geospatial analysis.\nPurpose of this document:\nThis resource will serve as a dynamic class note, where students can access detailed concepts, codes and exercises related to this class. Notes will be updated regularly as the class progresses with up-to-date material and upcoming assignments."

    "text": "4.2 Basics of ggplot\nWhereas base R has an “ink on paper” plotting paradigm, ggplot has a “grammar of graphics” paradigm that packages together a variety plotting functions. With ggplot, you assign the result of a function to an object name and then modify it by adding additional functions. Think of it as adding layers using pre-designed functions rather than having to build those functions yourself, as you would have to do with base R.\n\nl1 = ggplot(data=dat, aes(x = Year, y = Jan, color = \"blue\")) + # Tell which data to plot\n  geom_line() +      # Add a line\n  geom_point() +     # Add a points\n  xlab(\"Year\") +     # Add labels to the axes\n  ylab(\"Value\")\n\n# Or, they can be specified for any individual geometry\nl1 + geom_line(linetype = \"solid\", color=\"Blue\")  # Add a solid line\n\n\n\nl1 + geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = January)) # Add a different data set\n\n\n\n# There are tons of other built-in color scales and themes, such as scale_color_grey(), scale_color_brewer(), theme_classic(), theme_minimal(), and theme_dark()\n\n# OR, CREATE YOUR OWN THEME! You can group themes together in one list\ntheme1 = theme(\n  legend.position = \"none\",\n  panel.background = element_blank(),\n  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n  axis.line = element_line(color = \"black\"),\n  axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 11),\n  axis.text.x   = element_text(size = 11),\n  axis.title.y  = element_text(size = 11),\n  axis.title.x  = element_text(size = 11),\n  panel.border = element_rect(\n    colour = \"black\",\n    fill = NA,\n    size = 0.5\n  )\n)"

    "text": "4.3 Multivariate plots\nFor multivariate data, ggplot takes the data in the form of groups. This means that each data row should be identifiable to a group. To get the most out of ggplot, we will need to reshape our dataset.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# There are two generally data formats: wide (horizontal) and long (vertical). In the horizontal format, every column represents a category of the data. In the vertical format, every row represents an observation for a particular category (think of each row as a data point). Both formats have their comparative advantages. We will now convert the data frame we randomly generated in the previous section to the long format. Here are several ways to do this:\n\n# Using the gather function (the operator %&gt;% is called pipe operator)\ndat2 = dat %&gt;% gather(Month, Value, -Year)\n\n# This is equivalent to: \ndat2 = gather(data=dat, Month, Value, -Year)\n\n# Using pivot_longer and selecting all of the columns we want. This function is the best!\ndat2 = dat %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(Jan, Feb, Mar), names_to = \"Month\", values_to = \"Value\") \n\n# Or we can choose to exclude the columns we don't want\ndat2 = dat %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -c(Year,January), names_to = \"Month\", values_to = \"Value\") \n\nhead(dat2) # The data is now shaped in the long format\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n   Year January Month  Value\n  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  1913    46.1 Jan    -8.48\n2  1913    46.1 Feb   -15.6 \n3  1913    46.1 Mar    -8.09\n4  1914    70.6 Jan    -9.29\n5  1914    70.6 Feb    -2.36\n6  1914    70.6 Mar    -3.89\n\n\nLine plot\n\n# LINE PLOT\nl = ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Month)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = Month)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Month))\nl\n\n\n\n\nDensity plot\n\n# DENSITY PLOT\nd = ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Value))\nd = d + geom_density(aes(color = Month, fill = Month), alpha=0.4) # Alpha specifies transparency\nd\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\n\n# HISTOGRAM\nh = ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Value))\nh = h + geom_histogram(aes(color = Month, fill = Month), alpha=0.4,\n                 fill = \"white\",\n                 position = \"dodge\")\nh\n\n\n\n\nGrid plotting and saving files to disk\nThere are multiple ways to arrange multiple plots and save images. One method is using grid.arrange() which is found in the gridExtra package. You can then save the file using ggsave, which comes with the ggplot2 library.\n\n# The plots can be displayed together on one image using \n# grid.arrange from the gridExtra package\nimg = grid.arrange(l, d, h, nrow=3)\n\n\n\n# Finally, plots created using ggplot can be saved using ggsave\nggsave(\"grid_plot_1.png\", \n       plot = img, \n       device = \"png\", \n       width = 6, \n       height = 4, \n       units = c(\"in\"), \n       dpi = 600)\n\nAnother approach is to use the plot_grid function, which is in the cowplot library. Notice how the axes are now beautifally aligned.\n\nimg2=cowplot::plot_grid(l, d, h, nrow = 3, align = \"v\") # \"v\" aligns vertical axes and \"h\" aligns horizontal axes\n\nggsave(\"grid_plot_2.png\", \n       plot = img2, \n       device = \"png\", \n       width = 6, \n       height = 4, \n       units = c(\"in\"), \n       dpi = 600)"
