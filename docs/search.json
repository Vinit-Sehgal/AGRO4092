    "text": "1 Introduction\nStatistical computing is essential for scientific inquiry, discovery, and storytelling. As the availability of dataset and access to computing has significantly increased over the recent years, the scope of scientific inquiry is restricted, only, by the imagination of the inquirer.\n\n“Scientific inquiry starts with observation. The more one can see, the more one can investigate” — Martin Chalfie\n\nHowever, analysis of large-scale geospatial data (regional- to global scale at high spatial and temporal resolution) can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when working with multiple formats and sources of data. R- a higher-level programming language, provides a powerful computational alternative to popular Geographic Information System (GIS) software to organize, analyze and visualize geospatial datasets. R enjoys a vast collection of open-source libraries for GIS-type operations and proven statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities.\nIn this course, we equip ourselves with hands-on knowledge of accessing, analyzing, and visualizing open-source satellite remote-sensing and geospatial datasets for hydrological, agricultural, and climatological studies within the R environment. The objective of this course is to learn R for:\n\nAnalyzing geospatial datasets (raster and vector),\nPerforming statistical analysis for each feature/ layer, and,\nMapping and visualizing spatial datasets.\n\nThe course will include the latest R tools for working with global Earth-observation datasets, such as from NASA’s MODIS and SMAP satellites. Basic operations of geospatial analysis such as (re)projection, (re)sampling, summary statistics, merge/join, and (re)shape will be covered. The students will be introduced to structured/layered spatial datasets such as NetCDF and HDF formats used in climate modeling. Special emphasis will be placed on applying available out-of-the-box parallel computing techniques for geospatial analysis available in R.\nWe will first start with a refresher of basic R programming in Module 1. In Module 2 and 3, we will explore spatial data visualization, before we learn about large-scale application of parallel computing for geospatial analysis.\nPurpose of this document:\nThis resource will serve as a dynamic class note, where students can access detailed concepts, codes and exercises related to this class. Notes will be updated regularly as the class progresses with up-to-date material and upcoming assignments.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement:\n\n\nWe thank Debasish Mishra (Texas A&M University) for his generous contributions to the content of this resource over the years."

    "text": "2.1 Operators and data types\n\n2.1.1 Basic operators\nIn this section, we will learn about some basic R operators that are used to perform operations on variables. Some most commonly used operators are shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n\nR follows the conventional order (sequence) to solve mathematical operations, abbreviated as BODMAS: Brackets, Orders (exponents), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction\n\n\n2+4+7 # Sum\n\n[1] 13\n\n4-5   # Subtraction\n\n[1] -1\n\n2*3   # Multiplication\n\n[1] 6\n\n1/2   # Division\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n# Order of operation\n1/2*3+4-5\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n1/2*(3+4-5)\n\n[1] 1\n\n1/(2*(3+4-5))\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n1/(2*3+4-5) \n\n[1] 0.2\n\n# Notice how output changes with the placement of operators\n\n# Other operators:\n2^3\n\n[1] 8\n\nlog(10)\n\n[1] 2.302585\n\nsqrt(4)\n\n[1] 2\n\npi\n\n[1] 3.141593\n\n# Clear the Environment\nrm(list=ls()) # rm is for remove,ls is short for list.

Try pasting ?sd in the console.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Data types\nIn R, data is stored as an “array”, which can be 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional. A 1-D array is called a “vector” and a 2-D array is a “matrix”. A table in R is called a “data frame” and a “list” is a container to hold a variety of data types. In this section, we will learn how to create matrices, lists and data frames in R.\n\n\n\n\n# Lets make a random matrix\ntest_mat = matrix( c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7), # The data elements \n  nrow=2,         # Number of rows \n  ncol=3,         # Number of columns \n  byrow = TRUE)   # Fill matrix by rows \n\ntest_mat = matrix( c(2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 7),nrow=2,ncol=3,byrow = TRUE) # Same result \ntest_mat\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2    4    3\n[2,]    1    5    7\n\ntest_mat[,2]      # Display all rows, and second column\n\n[1] 4 5\n\ntest_mat[2,]      # Display second row, all columns\n\n[1] 1 5 7\n\n# Types of datasets\nout = as.matrix(test_mat)\nout               # This is a matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2    4    3\n[2,]    1    5    7\n\nout = as.array(test_mat)\nout               # This is also a matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2    4    3\n[2,]    1    5    7\n\nout = as.vector(test_mat)\nout               # This is just a vector\n\n[1] 2 1 4 5 3 7\n\n# Data frame and list\ndata1=runif(50,20,30) # Create 50 random numbers between 20 and 30  \ndata2=runif(50,0,10)  # Create 50 random numbers between 0 and 10  \n\n# Lists\nout = list()        # Create and empty list\nout[[1]] = data1    # Notice the brackets \"[[ ]]\" instead of \"[ ]\"\nout[[2]] = data2\nout[[1]]          # Contains data1 at this location\n\n [1] 28.03607 28.28414 29.55743 24.81166 23.56356 20.87268 24.88304 22.34165\n [9] 22.33368 20.25826 20.81706 29.89904 21.09240 20.30903 29.93504 21.07612\n[17] 29.65152 20.16253 28.34727 20.89910 29.89500 26.30626 26.04202 25.41055\n[25] 24.18526 27.45782 27.56318 20.43001 20.02291 25.66393 29.29413 20.76281\n[33] 29.94407 26.12573 21.30548 28.42610 28.13608 26.31496 21.86733 28.25949\n[41] 26.56981 20.13796 21.54988 25.67233 21.35313 29.36413 25.36869 23.96769\n[49] 22.19265 29.81581\n\n# Data frame\nout=data.frame(x=data1, y=data2)\n\n# Let's see how it looks!\nplot(out$x, out$y)\n\n\n\nplot(out[,1])\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a data frame, the dollar “$” sign invokes the variable selection.

    "text": "2.2 Plotting with base R\nIf you need to quickly visualize your data, base R has some functions that will help you do this in a pinch. In this section we’ll look at some basics of visualizing univariate and multivariate data.\n\n2.2.1 Overview\n\n# Create 50 random numbers between 0 and 100  \ndata=runif(50, 0, 100)   #runif stands for random numbers from a uniform distribution\n\n# Let's plot the data\nplot(data)            # The \"plot\" function initializes the plot.\n\n\n\nplot(data, type=\"l\")  # The \"type\" argument changes the plot type. \"l\" calls up a line plot\n\n\n\nplot(data, type=\"b\")  # Buffered points joined by lines\n\n\n\n# Try options type = \"o\" and type = \"c\" as well.\n\n# We can also quickly visualize boxplots, histograms, and density plots using the same procedure\nboxplot(data)        # Box-and-whisker plot\n\n\n\nhist(data)           # Histogram points\n\n\n\nplot(density(data))  # Plot with density distribution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Plotting univariate data\nLet’s dig deeper into the plot function. Here, we will look at how to adjust the colors, shapes, and sizes for markers, axis labels and titles, and the plot title.\n\n# Line plots\nplot(data,type=\"o\", col=\"red\",\n     xlab=\"x-axis title\",ylab =\"y-axis title\", \n     main=\"My plot\", # Name of axis labels and title\n     cex.axis=2, cex.main=2,cex.lab=2,            # Size of axes, title and label\n     pch=23,       # Change marker style\n     bg=\"red\",     # Change color of markers\n     lty=5,        # Change line style\n     lwd=2         # Selecting line width\n) \n# Adding legend\nlegend(1, 100, legend=c(\"Data 1\"),\n       col=c(\"red\"), lty=2, cex=1.2)\n\n\n\n# Histograms\nhist(data,col=\"red\",\n     xlab=\"Number\",ylab =\"Value\", main=\"My plot\", # Name of axis labels and title\n     border=\"blue\"\n) \n\n\n\n# Try adjusting the parameters:\n# hist(data,col=\"red\",\n#      xlab=\"Number\",ylab =\"Value\", main=\"My plot\", # Name of axis labels and title\n#      cex.axis=2, cex.main=2,cex.lab=2,            # Size of axes, title and label\n#      border=\"blue\", \n#      xlim=c(0,100), # Control the limits of the x-axis\n#      las=0,      # Try different values of las: 0,1,2,3 to rotate labels\n#      breaks=5    # Try using 5,20,50, 100\n# ) # Using more options and controls\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Plotting multivariate data\nHere, we introduce you to data frames: equivalent of tables in R. A data frame is a table with a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column.\n\nplot_data=data.frame(x=runif(50,0,10), \n                     y=runif(50,20,30), \n                     z=runif(50,30,40)) \n\nplot(plot_data$x, plot_data$y) # Scatter plot of x and y data\n\n\n\n# Mandatory beautification\nplot(plot_data$x,plot_data$y, xlab=\"Data X\", ylab=\"Data Y\", main=\"X vs Y plot\",\n     col=\"darkred\",pch=20,cex=1.5) # Scatter plot of x and y data\n\n\n\n# Multiple lines on one axis\nmatplot(plot_data, type = c(\"b\"),pch=16,col = 1:4) \n\n\n\nmatplot(plot_data, type = c(\"b\",\"l\",\"o\"),pch=16,col = 1:4) # Try this now. Any difference? \nlegend(\"topleft\", legend = 1:4, col=1:4, pch=1)            # Add legend to a top left\nlegend(\"top\", legend = 1:4, col=1:4, pch=1)                # Add legend to at top center\nlegend(\"bottomright\", legend = 1:4, col=1:4, pch=1)        # Add legend at the bottom right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Time series data\nWorking with time series data can be tricky at first, but here’s a quick look at how to quickly generate a time series using the as.Date function.\n\ndate=seq(as.Date('2011-01-01'),as.Date('2011-01-31'),by = 1) # Generate a sequence 31 days\ndata=runif(31,0,10)                 # Generate 31 random values between 0 and 10\ndf=data.frame(Date=date,Value=data) # Combine the data in a data frame\nplot(df,type=\"o\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Combining plots\nYou can built plots that contain subplots. Using base R, we call start by using the “par” function and then plot as we saw before.\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Call a plot with 4 quadrants\n\n# Plot 1\nmatplot(plot_data, type = c(\"b\"),pch=16,col = 1:4) \n\n# Plot 2\nplot(plot_data$x,plot_data$y) \n\n# Plot 3\nhist(data,col=\"red\",\n     xlab=\"Number\",ylab =\"Value\", main=\"My plot\", \n     border=\"blue\") \n\n# Plot4\nplot(data,type=\"o\", col=\"red\",\n     xlab=\"Number\",ylab =\"Value\", main=\"My plot\",\n     cex.axis=2, cex.main=2,cex.lab=2, \n     pch=23,   \n     bg=\"red\", \n     lty=5, \n     lwd=2 \n) \n\n\n\n# Alternatively, we can call up a plot using a matrix\nmatrix(c(1,1,2,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE) # Plot 1 is plotted for first two spots, followed by plot 2 and 3 \n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    1\n[2,]    2    3\n\nlayout(matrix(c(1,1,2,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)) # Fixes a layout of the plots we want to make\n\n # Plot 1\nmatplot(plot_data, type = c(\"b\"),pch=16,col = 1:4)\n\n# Plot2\nplot(plot_data$x,plot_data$y) \n\n# Plot 3\nhist(data,col=\"red\",\n     xlab=\"Number\",ylab =\"Value\", main=\"My plot\",\n     border=\"blue\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Saving figures to disk\nPlots can be saved as image files or a PDF. This is done by specifying the output file type, its size and resolution, then calling the plot.\n\npng(\"awesome_plot.png\", width=4, height=4, units=\"in\", res=400) \n#Tells R we will plot image in png of given specification\n\nmatplot(plot_data, type = c(\"b\",\"l\",\"o\"),pch=16,col = 1:4)  \nlegend(\"topleft\", legend = 1:4, col=1:4, pch=1)\n\ndev.off() # Very important: this sends the image to disc\n\npng \n  2 \n\n# Keep pressing till you get the following: \n# Error in dev.off() : cannot shut down device 1 (the null device) \n# This ensures that we are no longer plotting.\n\n# It looks like what everything we just plotted was squeezed together to tightly. Let's change the size.\npng(\"awesome_plot.png\", width=6, height=4, units=\"in\", res=400)  #note change in dimension\n#Tells R we will plot image in png of given specification\n\nmatplot(plot_data, type = c(\"b\",\"l\",\"o\"),pch=16,col = 1:3)  \nlegend(\"topleft\", legend = 1:3, col=1:3, pch=16)\n\ndev.off() \n\npng \n  2 \n\n\n\nSome useful resources\nIf you want to plot something a certain way and don’t know how to do it, the chances are that someone has asked that question before. Try a Google search for what your are trying to do and check out some of the forums. There is TONS of material online.

    "text": "2.3 Plotting with ggplot2\n\n2.3.1 Import libraries and create sample dataset\nFor this section, we will use the ggplot2, gridExtra, utils, and tidyr packages. gridExtra and cowplot are used to combine ggplot objects into one plot and utils and tidyr are useful for manipulating and reshaping the data. We will also install some packages here that will be required for the later sections. You will find more information in the sections to follow.\n\n###############################################################\n#~~~ Load required libraries\nlib_names=c(\"ggplot2\",\"gridExtra\",\"utils\",\"tidyr\",\"cowplot\", \"RColorBrewer\")\n\n# If you see a prompt: Do you want to restart R prior to installing: Select **No**. \n\n# Install all necessary packages (Run once)\n# invisible(suppressMessages\n#           (suppressWarnings\n#             (lapply\n#               (lib_names,install.packages,repos=\"http://cran.r-project.org\",\n#                 character.only = T))))\n\n# Load necessary packages\ninvisible(suppressMessages\n          (suppressWarnings\n            (lapply\n              (lib_names,library, character.only = T))))\n\nIn more day-to-day use, you will see yourself using a simpler version of these commands, such as, if you were to install the “ggplot2”,“gridExtra” libraries, you will type:\n\n# To install the package. Install only once\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n# To initialize the package. Invoke every time a new session begins.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nSimilarly, again for gridExtra ,\n\ninstall.packages(\"gridExtra\")\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nFor this exercise, let us generate a sample dataset.\n\n###############################################################\n#~~~ Generate a dataset containing random numbers within specified ranges\nYear = seq(1913,2001,1)\nJan = runif(89, -18.4, -3.2)\nFeb = runif(89, -19.4, -1.2)\nMar = runif(89, -14, -1.8)\nJanuary = runif(89, 1, 86)\ndat = data.frame(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, January)\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Basics of ggplot\nWhereas base R has an “ink on paper” plotting paradigm, ggplot has a “grammar of graphics” paradigm that packages together a variety plotting functions. With ggplot, you assign the result of a function to an object name and then modify it by adding additional functions. Think of it as adding layers using pre-designed functions rather than having to build those functions yourself, as you would have to do with base R.\n\nl1 = ggplot(data=dat, aes(x = Year, y = Jan, color = \"blue\")) + # Tell which data to plot\n  geom_line() +      # Add a line\n  geom_point() +     # Add a points\n  xlab(\"Year\") +     # Add labels to the axes\n  ylab(\"Value\")\n\n# Or, they can be specified for any individual geometry\nl1 + geom_line(linetype = \"solid\", color=\"Blue\")  # Add a solid line\n\n\n\nl1 + geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = January)) # Add a different data set\n\n\n\n# There are tons of other built-in color scales and themes, such as scale_color_grey(), scale_color_brewer(), theme_classic(), theme_minimal(), and theme_dark()\n\n# OR, CREATE YOUR OWN THEME! You can group themes together in one list\ntheme1 = theme(\n  legend.position = \"none\",\n  panel.background = element_blank(),\n  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n  axis.line = element_line(color = \"black\"),\n  axis.text.y   = element_text(size = 11),\n  axis.text.x   = element_text(size = 11),\n  axis.title.y  = element_text(size = 11),\n  axis.title.x  = element_text(size = 11),\n  panel.border = element_rect(\n    colour = \"black\",\n    fill = NA,\n    size = 0.5\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Multivariate plots\nFor multivariate data, ggplot takes the data in the form of groups. This means that each data row should be identifiable to a group. To get the most out of ggplot, we will need to reshape our dataset.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# There are two generally data formats: wide (horizontal) and long (vertical). In the horizontal format, every column represents a category of the data. In the vertical format, every row represents an observation for a particular category (think of each row as a data point). Both formats have their comparative advantages. We will now convert the data frame we randomly generated in the previous section to the long format. Here are several ways to do this:\n\n# Using the gather function (the operator %&gt;% is called pipe operator)\ndat2 = dat %&gt;% gather(Month, Value, -Year)\n\n# This is equivalent to: \ndat2 = gather(data=dat, Month, Value, -Year)\n\n# Using pivot_longer and selecting all of the columns we want. This function is the best!\ndat2 = dat %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(Jan, Feb, Mar), names_to = \"Month\", values_to = \"Value\") \n\n# Or we can choose to exclude the columns we don't want\ndat2 = dat %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -c(Year,January), names_to = \"Month\", values_to = \"Value\") \n\nhead(dat2) # The data is now shaped in the long format\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n   Year January Month  Value\n  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  1913    26.5 Jan    -4.56\n2  1913    26.5 Feb    -2.89\n3  1913    26.5 Mar    -2.62\n4  1914    53.8 Jan   -12.5 \n5  1914    53.8 Feb   -15.4 \n6  1914    53.8 Mar    -3.73\n\n\nLine plot\n\n# LINE PLOT\nl = ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Month)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = Month)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Month))\nl\n\n\n\n\nDensity plot\n\n# DENSITY PLOT\nd = ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Value))\nd = d + geom_density(aes(color = Month, fill = Month), alpha=0.4) # Alpha specifies transparency\nd\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\n\n# HISTOGRAM\nh = ggplot(dat2, aes(x = Value))\nh = h + geom_histogram(aes(color = Month, fill = Month), alpha=0.4,\n                 fill = \"white\",\n                 position = \"dodge\")\nh\n\n\n\n\nGrid plotting and saving files to disk\nThere are multiple ways to arrange multiple plots and save images. One method is using grid.arrange() which is found in the gridExtra package. You can then save the file using ggsave, which comes with the ggplot2 library.\n\n# The plots can be displayed together on one image using \n# grid.arrange from the gridExtra package\nimg = grid.arrange(l, d, h, nrow=3)\n\n\n\n# Finally, plots created using ggplot can be saved using ggsave\nggsave(\"grid_plot_1.png\", \n       plot = img, \n       device = \"png\", \n       width = 6, \n       height = 4, \n       units = c(\"in\"), \n       dpi = 600)\n\nAnother approach is to use the plot_grid function, which is in the cowplot library. Notice how the axes are now beautifally aligned.\n\nimg2=cowplot::plot_grid(l, d, h, nrow = 3, align = \"v\") # \"v\" aligns vertical axes and \"h\" aligns horizontal axes\n\nggsave(\"grid_plot_2.png\", \n       plot = img2, \n       device = \"png\", \n       width = 6, \n       height = 4, \n       units = c(\"in\"), \n       dpi = 600)\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Using patchwork for combining ggplots\nPatchwork works with simple operators to combine plots. The operator | arranges plots in a row. The plus sign + does the same but it will try to wrap the plots symmetrically as a square whenever possible. The division i.e. /operator layers a plot on top of another.\n\n#install.packages(\"patchwork\")\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nl+d\n\n\n\nl/ (h+d)\n\n\n\n# Try: l/d/h or (l+d)/h \n\n# Make your own design for arranging plots (the # sign means empty space): \ndesign &lt;- \"\n  111\n  2#3\n\"\nl + d + h + plot_layout(design = design)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful resources\nThe links below offer a treasure trove of examples and sample code to get you started.\n\nThe R Graph Gallery: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/\nR charts: https://r-charts.com/\nExcellent resource for combining multiple ggplots: https://r-charts.com/ggplot2/combining-plots/"

    "title": "3  Spatial Mapping in R",
    "section": "3.1 Overview",
    "text": "3.1 Overview\nIn this chapter we will learn about different types of spatial datasets (raster and vector). We will visualize these spatial datasets using static and interactive plotting options available in R. We will also explore different color palettes options available for generating spatial maps for scientific/technical reporting of spatial datasets. We will also learn briefly explore coordinate reference systems and map projections for spatial data representation.\n\n3.1.1 Sample dataset\nWe will familiarize ourselves with several open-source global datasets and use them to practice spatial mapping and computing in R.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal surface soil moisture from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite (Entekhabi, Njoku, and O’Neill 2009)\n\nhttps://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/\n\n\n\n\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Huete, Justice, and Van Leeuwen 1999)\n\nhttps://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php\n\n\n\n\nGlobal climate reference land regions from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) project (Iturbide et al. 2020)\n\nhttps://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/2959/2020/\n\n\n\n\nClimate classification (Hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, sub-humid and humid) based on Global Aridity Index Database (Zomer, Xu, and Trabucco 2022)\n\nhttps://csidotinfo.wordpress.com/2019/01/24/global-aridity-index-and-potential-evapotranspiration-climate-database-v3/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Data download\nThe sample dataset for this resource is uploaded to GitHub for easy access. Download the sample data manually as a zip file from: https://github.com/Vinit-Sehgal/SampleData . Once downloaded, extract the zip folder to the current working directory.\nAlternatively, use the following script to programmatically download and extract the sample data from the GitHub repository.\n\n###############################################################\n#~~~ Import sample data from GitHub repository\n\nif (dir.exists(\"SampleData-master\")==FALSE){ \n# First we check if the folder already exists.

A geographically referenced data (or geo-referenced data) is a spatial dataset which can be related to a point on Earth with the help of geographic coordinates. Types of geo-referenced spatial data include: rasters (grids of regularly sized pixels) and vectors (polygons, lines, points).\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick and helpful review of spatial data can be found here: https://spatialvision.com.au/blog-raster-and-vector-data-in-gis/\n\n3.1.3.1 Plotting raster data: with terra and tmap\nIn this section, we plot global raster data of surface (~5 cm) soil moisture from SMAP. Let’s start by first importing the global soil moisture raster.\n# Import package for raster operations\nlibrary(terra) \n\n# Import SMAP soil moisture raster from the downloaded folder\nsm=terra::rast(\"./SampleData-master/raster_files/SMAP_SM.tif\")\nOnce we have imported the SpatRaster (short for “spatial raster”) using rast() function from terra package, let’s note its attributes. Notice the dimensions, resolution, extent, crs i.e. coordinate reference system and values. Note that the cell of one raster layer can only hold a single numerical value.\n# Print raster attributes\nprint(sm)\nclass : SpatRaster dimensions : 456, 964, 1 (nrow, ncol, nlyr) resolution : 0.373444, 0.373444 (x, y) extent : -180, 180, -85.24595, 85.0445 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) coord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) source : SMAP_SM.tif name : SMAP_SM min value : 0.01999998 max value : 0.87667608\n# Try:\n# dim(sm)   # Dimension (nrow, ncol, nlyr) of the raster\n# terra::res(sm)   # X-Y resolution of the raster\n# terra::ext(sm)   # Spatial extent of the raster\n# terra::crs(sm)   # Coordinate reference system\nNow let’s plot the raster using terra::plot.\n# Basic Raster plot \nterra::plot(sm, main = \"Soil Moisture\") \n\n\n\n3.1.3.2 Scientific Color palettes\nUsing a good color palette is an important aspect of spatial mapping. Choice of a good colormap can help the readers understand the key aspects of the map. The selected colors must adequately represent the key features and their differences, wherever applicable, with the least distortion, ambiguity or effort. There are several libraries available in R specifically dedicated to generating color pelettes for scientific mapping. We will also learn the the usage of cetcolor and scico packages to generate perceptually uniform and color-blindness friendly palettes.\n\nSome key packages for generating color palettes for scientific mapping are:\n\nRColorBrewer: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3\ncetcolors (Perceptually Uniform Colour Maps): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cetcolor/vignettes/cet_color_schemes.html\nscico (Scientific colormaps): https://github.com/thomasp85/scico\n\n\n# Libraries for generating Colour palettes\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(cetcolor)\nlibrary(scico)\n\n# To view color palette \nlibrary(unikn)   \n\n#~~ A) User defined color palette using scico package\nmypal1 = scico::scico(20, alpha = 1.0, direction =  -1, palette = \"vik\") \nunikn::seecol(mypal1)   \n\n\n\n#Check: scico_palette_names() for available palettes! \n# Try combinations of alpha=0.5, direction =1, and various different color palette  \n\n#~~ B) User defined color palette using cetcolor package\nmypal2 = cetcolor::cet_pal(20, name = \"r2\")   \nunikn::seecol(mypal2)  \n\n\n\n# Or reverse color pal \nmypal2 = rev(cetcolor::cet_pal(20, name = \"r2\") )  \nunikn::seecol(mypal2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.3 Customizing terra plot options\nThere is a long list of customization operations available while plotting rasters in R.\nWe will start with basic plot from terra, and then explore the function by changing different customization options , such as: Try horizontal=TRUE, interpolate=FALSE, change xlim=c(-180, 180) with asp=1, or try legend.shrink=0.4.\n\nsm=rast(\"./SampleData-master/raster_files/SMAP_SM.tif\") # SMAP soil moisture data\n\nterra::plot(sm,\n            main = \"Scientific Plot of Raster\",\n            \n            #Color options\n            col = mypal2,                    # User Defined Color Palette\n            breaks = seq(0, 1, by=0.1),      # Sequence from 0-1 with 0.1 increment\n            colNA = \"lightgray\",             # Color of cells with NA values\n            \n            # Axis options      \n            axes=TRUE,                       # Plot axes: TRUE/ FALSE\n            xlim=c(-180, 180),               # X-axis limit\n            ylim=c(-90, 90),                 # Y-axis limit\n            xlab=\"Longitude\",                # X-axis label\n            ylab=\"Latitue\",                  # Y-axis label\n            \n            # Legend options      \n            legend=TRUE,                     # Plot legend: TRUE/ FALSE\n            \n            # Miscellaneous\n            mar = c(3.1, 3.1, 2.1, 7.1),     # Margins\n            grid = FALSE                     # Add grid lines\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.4 Spatial plotting with tmap\n\nlibrary(tmap)\n# Set tmap mode: Static plot=\"plot\", Interactive plots=\"view\"\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")          \n\ntmap_SM = tm_shape(sm)+\n  tm_grid(alpha = 0.2)+                             # Transparency of grid\n  tm_raster(alpha = 0.7,                            # Transparency of raster plot\n            palette = mypal2,                       # Color pellete\n            style = \"pretty\",                       # Select style\n            title = \"Volumetric Soil Moisture\")+    # Plot main title\n  tm_layout(legend.position = \n              c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))+                 # Placement of legend\n  tm_xlab(\"Longitude\")+                             # x-lab\n  tm_ylab(\"Latitude\")                               # y-lab \n\ntmap_SM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.5 Interactive raster visualization aster data with mapview\nFunctionality of terra is largely similar to the legacy package raster (created by the same developer, Robert Hijmans). The development of terra is inspired by computational efficiency in geospatial operations. However, since terra is relatively new, and is continually developed, several other packages require conversion of the SpatRasters to rasterLayer for backwards compatibility.\nTo convert a SpatRaster to RasterLayer, use: sm2=as(sm, \"Raster\")\n\nlibrary(mapview)\nlibrary(raster)\n\n# Convert SpatRaster to raster (from package raster)\nsm2=as(sm, \"Raster\")\nmapview(sm2,                  # RasterLayer\n        col.regions = mypal2, # Color palette \n        at=seq(0, 0.8, 0.1)   # Breaks\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntekhabi, Dara, Eni Njoku, and Peggy O’Neill. 2009. “The Soil Moisture Active and Passive Mission (SMAP): Science and Applications.” 2009 IEEE Radar Conference. https://doi.org/10.1109/radar.2009.4977030.\n\n\nHuete, Alfredo, Chris Justice, and Wim Van Leeuwen. 1999. “MODIS Vegetation Index (MOD13).” Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document 3 (213): 295–309.\n\n\nIturbide, Maialen, José M.
