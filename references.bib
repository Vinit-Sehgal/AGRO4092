Remote-sensing images require various types of systematic corrections for noise and geometric distortion. They also require radiometric calibration for accurate comparisons between dates and sensors. Rectification of system-corrected products to maps can be implemented over limited areas with moderate topographic relief by global polynomial functions. Resampling for geometric correction alters the local spatial and global radiometric properties of the image. Nearest-neighbor resampling does not introduce any new pixel spectral vectors into the data, bilinear resampling introduces new vectors within the original digital number (DN) range, and cubic resampling introduces new vectors within and outside the original DN range. Noise correction is necessary only if the noise will affect information extraction. It is best done before any resampling of the imagery. Local noise is removed with a variety of spatial filters, while global periodic noise is removed with Fourier filters. Unequal detector calibration noise or striping can be corrected by a global image-based adjustment of each detector's response. Uncorrelated noise in multispectral images may be removed by spectral decorrelation techniques such as the principal component transfer (PCT). Full calibration of remote sensing imagery requires sensor calibration and atmospheric and topographic effects correction. Hyperspectral imagery presents special calibration challenges but also provides some atmospheric data that is useful for calibration.}
